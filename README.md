This research aims to design and implement a combination of Piezoelectric generator with Internet of things (IoT) Technology. The kit consists of hardware and software parts. The hardware part comprises of (a) a Piezoelectric material attached to the tiles which is connected to an inverter, this produces and saves energy to power IoT, (b) a PIR sensor which detects the change in infrared radiation of warm blooded moving object in its detection range, (c) a Temperature sensor that senses the current temperature of the room, (d) a Relay to control the ON/OFF of fan and light of the room when the number of people inside the room is zero, (e) a Digital display, (f) a DC Motor and all of these connected to (g) Arduino uno microprocessor. The software part uses C++ with an addition of special methods and functions for designing the microcontroller Arduino Uno. The major advantage of the kit is the production of green energy to run the power saving systems which saves power up to 25-30% of our daily usage. This work will highly be helpful in encouraging people to prefer green energy at a very low cost. The projected plan will certainly give a high power saving efficiency with atmost satisfaction of using a renewable form of energy.
